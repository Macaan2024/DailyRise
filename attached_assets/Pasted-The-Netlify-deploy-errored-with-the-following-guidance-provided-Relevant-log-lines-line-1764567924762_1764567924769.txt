The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

- Relevant log lines
  - [line 10](#L10) shows Node: v22.21.1 in the build environment.
  - [line 73](#L73) the build command starts: npm run build.
  - [line 76](#L76) the build runs react-scripts: Creating an optimized production build...
  - [line 77](#L77) build failed: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2

Diagnosis
- Error type: build step failed during the Create React App production build (react-scripts build).
- Likely cause: an incompatible Node.js version (Node 22) in the Netlify build environment. Create React App / react-scripts and some of its dependencies commonly require a current LTS Node (e.g., Node 18 or 20) and may break on newer Node majors. The logs show the build aborted immediately after react-scripts began, which is consistent with a Node compatibility issue.

Solution
1. Pin a supported Node version for Netlify (recommended: Node 18 or 20 LTS).
   - Add an .nvmrc at the repo root (recommended) — commit and push it:
```text
# .nvmrc
18
```
   - OR add engines to package.json:
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "18.x"
  }
}
```
   - OR set Netlify build environment in netlify.toml:
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18.20.0"
```
   Commit and push whichever file you add.

2. Rebuild locally to verify:
   - Install/use the pinned Node: nvm install 18 && nvm use 18
   - Reinstall deps and run build: npm ci && npm run build
   - Fix any build errors that appear locally before redeploying.

3. Redeploy on Netlify. Netlify will pick up .nvmrc or package.json engines (or the NODE_VERSION env var) and use that Node version for the build.

Notes
- If after pinning Node the build still fails, run the local build under the same Node version and paste the full error output — that will reveal the exact failing file or dependency to diagnose further.
